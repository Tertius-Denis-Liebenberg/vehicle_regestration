    <h2>Contractor Vehicles</h2>
    <p>Now for the Vehicle page. I would like to have a table that shows (type, regestration number, model and weight in tons and an extra column for buttons) there should be a button that adds a new vehicle and the popup should ask the user for all the information as well as have a dropdown to select a contractor to link to the vehicle. the last column of the table will have an edit button</p>
